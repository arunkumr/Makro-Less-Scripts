# Makro-Less-Scripts
Less Scripts that i frequently use as part of my projects.

# Grid.less
I came up with this Less based Grid setup, when i needed a semantic yet responsive CSS Grid System. It does the job of generating responsive CSS similar to Bootstrap's Less scripts only but made by me.

```@import "grid.less";
.gauge
{	
	.make-grid(@sm,1,4);
	.make-grid(1,2); 
}```
